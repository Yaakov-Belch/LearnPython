# LearnPython

You already know scripting languages well (e.g. JavaScript, Perl).  
You want a focused path to learn python: How does it connect to what you already know and what's new to you.

* [BabyPython](BabyPython.md): The syntax for what you already know; context for what follows...

Topics to cover:

* regular expressions
* flow control: break continue
* OP, class definitions
* sections of the standard library
* list and dict comprehensions
* ecpeption handling: try raise
* decorators
* numpy
* tensorflow

Assorted:

* coroutines yield pass await generators future
* scoping: global nonlocal
* multi-line strings
* named arguments
* range 1..10
* array slices[::]
* assert
* del
* with
* return
* versions: puthon2/3 implementations
* string/tuple/list slicing [start:end:stride]

Are there such features?

* destructing assignment/unpacking assignment // arguments
