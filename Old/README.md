# LearnPython

I already know scripting (Perl, JavaScript) that arguably have a lot in common with Python.

My first step is to explore what I *already know and understand:* Just learn the right syntax for
the pieces of Python that are shared with other languages.  In this step, I ignore features that
are different *on purpose:* They will be covered in the second step.

* [BabyPython](BabyPython.md): The language for basic algorithms
* [Generators](Generators.md): Generators: a lazy sequence of values
* [Async](Async.md): Async functions for efficient parallel communication
